  <h2>Their Accomplishments</h2>
  <p><strong>4-Time Fifa Women's World Cup Champion</strong></p>
  <dl>
	<dt><strong>1991 Womens World Cup</strong></dt>
	  <dd>The United States won the 1991 Womens World Cup which took place in China. The funny thing about this World Cup was that it was actually called the M&M Cup. The US defeated Norway by a score of 2-1 with Michelle Akers leading the team with both of the goals in the final as well as 10 goals in the tournament.The United States scored 25 goals in the tournament and only conceded only 5 goals.</dd>
	<dt><strong>1999 Women's World Cup</strong></dt>
	  <dd>The United States won the 1999 World Cup that took place in the United States. This tournament was a unique one for the women in the sense that this was the first time that anyone had won the World Cup on home soil. The United States defeated China in the finals finally on penalty kicks. However, it was the grit of Michelle Akers playing through chronic fatigue and defending the best player of the tournament, Sun Wen and Kristine Lilly's goal line save that got us to Penalty Kicks. In the end, Brianna Scurry saved one and Brandi Chastain scored the winning kick to win the tournament.</dd>
	<dt><strong>2015 Women's World Cup</strong></dt>
	  <dd>The United States won their third title in 2015 in Canada. This ended the US's 16 year drought and they became the first team to win three Women's World Cup titles. The United States smashed through the tournament only conceding three goals and scoring 14 goals. Carli Llyod led the way scoring on the team with 6 and Hope Solo anchored the goal with strong performances. There was also breakout performances by Julie Ertz and Morgan Brian.</dd>
	<dt><strong>2019 Women's World Cup</strong></dt>
	  <dd>The United States dominated the 2019 World Cup that occurred in France. They started the tournament blazing with Alex Morgan scoring 5 goals and the United States scoring 13 against Thailand. The United States defeated the Netherlands in the finals 2-0 with goals by Megan Rapinoe and Rose Lavelle, however they had to take powerhouses along the way to claim the title. This included the host nation, France, rising Spain and England all to just reach the finals.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p><strong>4-Time Olympic Soccer Champion</strong></p>
  <dl>
	<dt><strong>1996 Olympics</strong></dt>
	  <dd>The 1996 Summer Olympics took place in various locations across the United States. The 1996 Olympics were a special Olympics because they were the first ones that offered womens soccer as a sport. The United States made it to the finals with a Golden goal against their arch rivals, Norway by Shannon MacMillan. In the finals, MacMillan scored the fist goal for the United States, with Tiffeny Milbrett scoring the winning goal in the 68th minute against China.</dd>
	<dt><strong>2004 Olympics</strong></dt>
	  <dd>The 2004 Summer Olympics took place in Greece. This was a special event as it would be the last one for the 99ers, including Mia Hamm, Kristine Lilly, Brandi Chastain, Julie Foudy and Joy Fawcett. In this tournament we saw the rise of such fresh faces including Abby Wambach and Heather O'Reilley. The United States won the final against Brazil in extra time with the goal actually scored by one of the fresh faces, Abby Wambach in the 112th minute.</dd> 
	<dt><strong>2008 Olympics</strong></dt>
	  <dd>The United States won their second straight Olympics games in 2008 in China. It was not smooth sailing for the United States as they actually lost one of their group stage matches to Norway, however they would still come up as winner of their group. In the final, we again faced Brazil and the lone goal was from Carli Llyod. This would be the start of Carli Llyod coming in clutch for the United States. In addition, this will be the start of the dominance of Hope Solo in the goal for the United States anchoring down the defense.</dd>
	<dt><strong>2012 Olympics</strong></dt>
	  <dd>The 2012 Olympics was one to watch that took place in the United Kingdom. The United States would go through undefeated through the entire tournament with a dynamic front and a strong back line. The duo of Abby Wamnbach and Alex Morgan would prove to be dangerous and even scarier with the addition of Megan Rapinoe. To get to the finals, the United States would have to defeat their enemy from Concacaf, Canada and would have to answer back three times from a Christine Sinclair goal to stay even. But then, in double overtime in the 123rd minute a ball was served in the middle straight to Morgan's head and went in for a 4-3 victory to the United States. The United States would then meet Japan, who they met in the previous World Cup to become champion. There, Carli Llyod once again came in clutch with scoring both goals for the United States in the 2-1 victory!</dd>
